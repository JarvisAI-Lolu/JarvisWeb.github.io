                <h1>Hi..Thanks for visiting my website!!</h1>
                <p>I'm Lohith.S a.ka. Leo Stark and I'm an self-taught programmer.
                    I have an IQ of 124.
                    I recently learned Python coding and created an Artificial Intelligence virtual assistant called JARVIS and it has many functions.
                    Moreover I also know Java and JavaScript coding and have coded many snippets.
                    To develop this website, I even learned HTML and CSS.
                    Recently bought a Raspberry Pi and have been doing some projects with it ever since.
                    I created this website to free up some of the time I spend on Online classes and also to automate the way of how I join my classes.
                    Automating things isn't new to me, I had coded an AI Coder which used to save me the time I used to spend on writing code especially Java and HTML.
